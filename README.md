# Weather App 🌤️🌡️

## Introduction

This Python script fetches and displays the current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The program retrieves real-time weather data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and general weather conditions, and prints it in a readable format. It demonstrates how to make API requests in Python, handle JSON responses, and implement basic error handling in case the API call fails or the city name is invalid.

## How to Run ▶️

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Install the requests library if not already installed:

pip install requests


Save the script as weather_app.py.

Run the script using:
